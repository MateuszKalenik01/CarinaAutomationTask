# Selenium Automation Framework

## Overview

This project is a Selenium-based test automation framework designed to interact with and test a web application: [demoblaze.com](https://www.demoblaze.com). The framework uses Java, TestNG, and Selenium WebDriver to perform various web UI operations and verifications. Logging is handled via SLF4J with Log4j for detailed and informative logs.

## Features

- Abstracted WebDriver operations for cleaner test code.
- Custom annotation for descriptive logging.
- Dynamic waits using WebDriverWait.
- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainable and reusable code.
- TestNG for test execution and management.
- Log4j for configurable and detailed logging.
